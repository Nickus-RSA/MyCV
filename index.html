            <h1>Nickus</h1>
            <p>I am a hard working, focused and playful person who loves solving problems, likes building connections with others through common interests. I am adaptable and result driven.</p>
            <p>My experiences up until now are mainly financial and sales orientated, with a splash of computer related problems to solve (mostly basic application problems) </p>
            <p>Career wise my biggest passion would be to work in Tech development seeing at is what the future holds for us and of course for the fact that computers are truly fascinating and so complex, it gives the most satisfaction, once you are able to solve a problem.</p>
            <p>My goal might simple and boring, but I believe it is worth pursuing... I want to be in a career I can enjoy, which excites me and one day maybe be able to provide a great living for a family</p>
